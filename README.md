# Beat the Bot

## Motivation

Beat the Bot was designed as an introductory project for freshers to learn **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** through **game development**. Since many students are naturally interested in games, this project leverages that interest to teach AI/ML concepts in an engaging and intuitive way.
Additionally, games provide an excellent framework for modeling real-world scenarios, reinforcing practical problem-solving skills.

---

## Project Overview

Beat the Bot is built using **Unity** and the **ML-Agents** framework to train intelligent agents within interactive game environments. The project integrates a **Python 3.9 backend** with **C#-based Unity agents**, emphasizing structured code, clarity, and iterative performance improvements throughout the project timeline.

Over a period of four weeks, the project progressively introduced complexity while reinforcing core AI/ML and software engineering principles.

---

## Tools & Technologies

* **Unity** 2022.3.62f3
* **Python** 3.9
* **ML-Agents** (Python 0.30.0 & Unity 2.0.2)
* **TensorBoard** (training visualization)
* **Git & GitHub** (version control and collaboration)

These tools were carefully chosen to ensure **maximum compatibility** across mentee systems, resulting in minimal setup and versioning issues.

## Final Deliverable

An **Arcade Game Launcher** featuring four games, each developed over one week:

1. **Pong**
2. **Tic-Tac-Toe**
3. **Top-Down Shooter**
4. **Chess**

Players can compete against AI-controlled bots, showcasing different learning paradigms and difficulty levels.
