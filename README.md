# **Beat the Bot**

## Motivation

#### The project inititally was given as a suggestion to be taught for freshers so that we can introduce concepts of artificial intelligence and machine learning for games. We wanted to provide them with learning opportunities in AI&ML by teaching it through their hobby, that is game making. Also, games can very well be used to model real life scenarios which is another motive behind the project.

## Project Overview

#### Beat The Bot uses Unity to model environments, ML Agents Unity Package as its interface layer between Python 3.9 backend, and also a agent scripted in C# within Unity itself. We practiced structured and legible code writing practices throughout the project while also improving accuracy, reliability and performance every week during the project.

## Tools Used

1.  Unity 2022.3.62f3
2.  Python 3.9
3.  ML Agents 0.30.0 Python package and its dependancies
4.  ML Agents 2.0.2 Unity package
5.  Tensorboard
6.  Git and GitHub

#### The tools were selected accordingly to ensure universal compatibility across devices of mentees and we successfully had almost no version or compatibility issues in the setup part.

## Final Deliverable

#### An arcade game launcher where u get to play against bots in 4 different games. We made 4 games in the overall 4-week duration of the project, 1 per-week. They include:
1.  Pong
2.  Tic-Tac-Toe
3.  Top-Down Shooter
4.  Chess

## Instructions to run the project

#### Download the final build .zip file in the [link][1] provided. Then just open ArcadeLauncher.exe and choose to play your favourite games

## Challenges

1.  When we had to begin the project, we had to learn through a lot of tools and making sure no mentees spend no extra minute in troubleshooting version compatibility issues. This took a lot of trial and error attempts between mentors but the outcome turned out to be beautiful.
2.  We didn't have majority of our mentees familiar with the tools we were using. Many of them were doing a learning and development level project for the first time.
3.  Overwhelming content during the starting phase of the project.
4.  Ensuring consistency and maintaining motivation across mentees.
5.  Even the mentors had limited experience with the specific tools but were exposed to the overall framework of ML and Unity at a higher level through various competitions and contests already.
6.  Structuring the project and handling delays.

## How did we tackle them?

1.  At the initial week of the project, mentors provided the mentees with a well built but simple Unity Project template. This ensured, they had enough freedom to modify the environment in Unity while also not getting overwhelmed by the initial spike in learning curve.
2.  Every week, mentors provided mentees with notes and video lectures from well perceived YouTube videos. This ensured uniform and fun learning thorught the project.
3.  Mentors provided them with well-thought and well-written assignments which helped the mentees to maintain a very good learning progress and stay up-to-date with the project.
4.  Sessions were conducted on a regular basis, atleast thrice a week to keep everyone on track.

## Key Learnings

1.  All mentors and mentees at the end of the project could confidently tell that if they can think and model an real life situation in Unity as an environment, they can very well get the best solution to problems within the environment.
2.  Industry-grade code writing practices, ensuring structured and legible code.
3.  Team collaboration through Git and GitHub.
4.  Implementing machine learning concepts to improvise games.
5.  How can we model real life scenarios with games.
